How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Ans.
It will allow me to be able to make new versions and iterations faster. In case of failure of new version to work I
can simply check for errors comparing with the previous versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Ans.
The documents are constantly updated and fear of loosing data due to power failure and closing the application prematurely is
non existent.
Also since the documents are in a google cloud they are backed up regularly and manual backup is not necessary.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google
Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans.
This is because each of them were made with different use cases. Google Docs for sharing rich text format and collaboration,
whereas git was built by Linus for the purpose of sharing code and collaborating with each other at the same time.
A program code can span multiple files and folders and interacting with each other, whereas documents do funcion as a single
entity and are mostly separate from one another.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans.
Move to the folder where the repository clone is located.
run command $git log
It will display the commit logs. Press q to quit viewing the log.
One can then use $git diff command to check the changes between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Ans.
I would not have to worry about being able to go back to working copy again in case I break something already working.
